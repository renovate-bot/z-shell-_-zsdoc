# First of all, ensure predictable parsing.
# In zsh <= 5.2, `alias -L` emits aliases that begin with a plus sign ('alias -- +foo=42')
# them without a '--' guard, so they don't round trip.
#
# Hence, we exclude them from unaliasing:

# Set $0 to the expected value, regardless of functionargzero.
  # $0 is reliable
    # When running from a source tree without 'make install', $ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_REVISION
    # would be set to '$Format:%H$' literally.  That's an invalid value, and obtaining
    # the valid value (via `git rev-parse HEAD`, as Makefile does) might be costly, so:

# Array declaring active highlighters names.

# Update ZLE buffer syntax highlighting.
#
# Invokes each highlighter that needs updating.
# This function is supposed to be called whenever the ZLE state changes.

# Apply highlighting based on entries in the zle_highlight array.
# This function takes four arguments:
# 1. The exact entry (no patterns) in the zle_highlight array:
#    region, paste, isearch, or suffix
# 2. The default highlighting that should be applied if the entry is unset
# 3. and 4. Two integer values describing the beginning and end of the
#    range. The order does not matter.

# API/utility functions for highlighters
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Array used by highlighters to declare user overridable styles.

# Whether the command line buffer has been modified or not.
#
# Returns 0 if the buffer has changed since _zsh_highlight was last called.

# Whether the cursor has moved or not.
#
# Returns 0 if the cursor has moved since _zsh_highlight was last called.

# Add a highlight defined by ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES.
#
# Should be used by all highlighters aside from 'pattern' (cf. ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_PATTERN).
# Overwritten in tests/test-highlighting.zsh when testing.

# Setup functions
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Helper for _zsh_highlight_bind_widgets
# $1 is name of widget to call

# Rebind all ZLE widgets to make them invoke _zsh_highlights.

# Load highlighters from directory.
#
# Arguments:
#   1) Path to the highlighters directory.


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Setup
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Try binding widgets.

# Resolve highlighters directory location.

# Reset scratch variables when commandline is done.

# Load zsh/parameter module if available

# Initialize the array of active highlighters if needed.

# Restore the aliases we unned

# Set $?.
