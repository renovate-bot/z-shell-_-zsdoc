# Apply highlighting based on entries in the zle_highlight array.
# This function takes four arguments:
# 1. The exact entry (no patterns) in the zle_highlight array:
#    region, paste, isearch, or suffix
# 2. The default highlighting that should be applied if the entry is unset
# 3. and 4. Two integer values describing the beginning and end of the
#    range. The order does not matter.
